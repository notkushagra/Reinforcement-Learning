# Reinforcement-Learning
Applied PPO algorithm implemented in [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) so as to solve [Car_Racing_v0](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/car_racing/) problem from Gym.AI environment. Note that Car_Racing_v0 belongs to [Box2D](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/) family of popular RL problems.
